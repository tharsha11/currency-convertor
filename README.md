Currency converter is a tool used to convert one countryâ€™s currency to another.
In this project by the knowledge of usage of currency converter a program is designed in java language.
In this Currency Converter application, it is going to display a web page where you can choose to display the converter or the exchange rate of one currency with all other currencies in the form of table.
Different countries use different currency, and there is daily variation in these currencies relative to one another. 
Those who transfer money from one country to another (one currency to another) must be updated with the latest currency exchange rates in the market.
Currency converter mini project is built keeping this thing in mind. 
This application can be used by any user, but it is mainly useful for business, shares, and finance related areas where money transfer and currency exchange takes place on a daily basis.
